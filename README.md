## :loudspeaker: About
The objective of the workshop is to showcase the use of AI hand tracking through learning sign language.
<!-- You can look at other TAP projects if you need a better idea of how to describe your workshops objectives -->

In this workshop, participants will learn sign language through the use of AI that will help guide them using hand tracking through a computer camera. They will learn how to spell one word before moving on to a fun memory game.

## :page_with_curl: Project Description
Participants begin by exploring an AI-powered hand tracking system that provides real-time feedback on their gestures. Unlike traditional sign language learning through videos, where learners often struggle to know whether their hand positions are accurate, this system uses computer vision to mirror participants’ movements and measure their accuracy.

During the workshop, learners will follow guided exercises in which an AI model recognizes their hand shapes and displays a matching 3D avatar performing the correct sign. The system highlights the percentage of accuracy (e.g., 90%, 98%, 100%) to help participants understand their progress before moving to the next gesture.

The project leverages technologies such as MediaPipe for hand tracking, allowing users to see their own skeletal hand overlay compared with the target gesture in real time. By doing so, participants not only practice sign language but also gain an interactive and immersive learning experience.

Compared to traditional methods—such as watching videos or attending in-person classes—this approach is more flexible and accessible. Learners can study anywhere, anytime, while receiving immediate feedback, which significantly increases engagement and retention. This interactive model transforms sign language learning into a process that is visual, participatory, and highly effective.
<!--keren 8.29.2025-->
In addition to practicing sign language, participants will also be introduced to the underlying technology behind the system. The workshop will cover how AI hand tracking works, including concepts of computer vision, gesture recognition, and how different components (such as MediaPipe, 3D models, and accuracy scoring) are integrated into one interactive platform. By walking through these technical elements, participants will not only experience the application but also gain insight into how to build such a system themselves.

* [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is a block-based programming language developed by the MIT Media Lab as an education tool for children to learn computing in a fun and interactive way.
* Scratch has drag-and-drop interfaces. Unlike text-based programming language like Java or C where you physically type every line of code, in Scratch, you can drag and drop pre-made codes and organize them into an algorithm. It's like solving a jigsaw puzzle!
* Explain why your team chose this technology for this workshop.
